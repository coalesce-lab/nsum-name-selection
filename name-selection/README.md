# Name selection for Network Scale-Up Method

This repostry implements a solution to select a subset of names which distribution over categories approximates the population distribution of one country over the same categories. The methodology can be applied to any country for which the number of people across each name in the population is known, and the distribution over different categories is also available, e.g., gender, age range, or territory. Here, the methodology is tested on **five countries**:

- Belgium
- Hungary
- Poland
- Sweeden
- Switzerland

To try the approach just open the **jupyter notebook**, and run each cell:

```
jupyter notebook
```
